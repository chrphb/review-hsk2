The objective of this module is to generate a study plan to study Chinese HSK2 from a raw data file.
The raw data has been created from the simple copy and paste from an original pdf document.
I want a study plan with the following:
- the modern chinese characters
- the pinyin
- the translation in french

Cleaning the data: there are some useless lines, and space is used as a deliminator in most case, but when the pinyin has more than one word, this doesn't work anymore, so we have to do a manual rework. But this is the minority of cases.
